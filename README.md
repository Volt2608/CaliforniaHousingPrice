🏠 California Housing Price Prediction

CaliforniaHousingPrice is an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts median house prices in California based on demographic, geographic, and economic features. The project focuses on building a robust, production-style ML pipeline rather than just model training.

The workflow includes data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and preprocessing using Scikit-learn pipelines and a ColumnTransformer for numerical and categorical features. Missing values are handled with imputation, features are scaled and encoded appropriately, and the dataset is split using stratified sampling to preserve income distribution.

Multiple regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are trained and evaluated to compare performance and generalization. The project emphasizes model evaluation, reproducibility, and clean code structure, making it suitable for real-world deployment scenarios.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in data preprocessing, machine learning workflows, and applied problem-solving in the real estate domain.
